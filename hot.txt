The shoulder straps have Stow-On-The-Go attachments for your trekking poles when the trail is nice and flat, and lower InsideOut straps compress the pack down quickly and simply.

It means getting you and your gear there, safely and comfortably. Lowe Alpine designed the Alpine Attack 45:55 Backpack with just that in mind. It's chock full of features to make your life easier, even when you're making things as difficult as possible. The Alpine Attack features glove-friendly buckles and straps so that you can make adjustments and transitions when the weather turns nasty, without risk of frostbite. Because there are times when you're going to need to wear a climbing harness, and packs just don't sit that comfortably over them, a stowable hip belt was added that allows the hip belt to be tucked back into the pack when you're wearing a climbing harness. The new award-winning HeadLocker axe attachment system will allow you to attach even the most new-fangled of leashless climbing tools. Never again do you need to get turned away mid-route by a steep section of ice for which you weren't able to bring the proper tools. Those tough choices are now a thing of the past. The movable strap under the lid allows you to reposition your attached rope or crampons, allowing access to the pack without having to constantly remove and reattach your vital equipment. The less time spent in transition means faster, safer climbing. Finally, because everyone knows that skiing down is more fun than walking down, Lowe Alpine added a versatile ski-carrying system that means you can easily carry your skis on the way up and shred pow on the way down.","863,862","Backcountry.com","http://www.backcountry.com/lowe-alpine-alpine-attack-4555-backpack-2700cu-in?CMP_SKU=LWA000M")

It turns out, women aren't simply smaller versions of men. Lowe Alpine created the women-specific Mountain Attack ND 35:45 Backpack with all the great bells and whistles you'd expect from a top-of-the-line pack, but with a back panel, harness, and hip belt that are shaped specifically for the female body.Glove-friendly buckles and zipper pulls ensure that you don't have to risk frostbite trying to dig out your multi-tool to fix that busted crampon again, and the movable crampon and rope holder under the lid allows you access the top of your pack without the hassle of constantly having to remove your stowed rope or crampons. The removable internal frame allows you to adapt your pack to the specific demands of the day, from lighter, single-day pushes to longer and more load-intensive endeavors. Extra gear loops on your hip belt give access to essential pieces of protection so you don't have to fumble around during the most challenging portions of your climb. The award-winning HeadLocker ice axe attachments let you securely strap on even the most newfangled of ice tools. Let's be honest, the last thing you want to think about when throwing that heel hook over the crux is whether or not your axe is going to snag on something and drag you back down. When you're lying in bed mentally checking off your gear for the next day's climb, fall asleep happy knowing that the Mountain Attack has got you covered, and the only thing you need to worry about is that 3 a. m. wake-up call.","863,862","Backcountry.com","http://www.backcountry.com/lowe-alpine-mountain-attack-nd-3545-backpack-womens-2135-2745cu-in?CMP_SKU=LWA000L")

Once you're moving on the trail, a plastic sheet and aluminum stays running along your back support your load as well as keep items inside the backpack from rubbing up against you. The back panel is fully padded, and includes a ventilating channel for enhanced comfort. The large main compartment with a drawstring closure provides plenty of room for your tent and bear canister, and keep your sleeping bag in a separate zippered compartment with an internal shelf (for holding whatever else you want to separate out with your sleeping bag).

Minimalist in looks but not necessarily in features, the ACT Trail Pro features multiple access points at the top of the bag as well as through a zippered front panel for quick access to deeply packed items. The lid is fitted with a zippered pocket for your lunch as well as an internal valuables pocket for your phone, keys, and emergency cash. Stretch side pockets stow your extra layers, water, and hat, while a hydration compatible design allow you to carry a three-liter bladder for easy, on-trail hydration. A wet and dry storage compartment keeps your rain gear separate from your sleeping bag, and multiple gear loops at the front of the pack will carry two trekking poles, an ice axe, and an additional helmet holder (sold separately). For support, the ACT Trail Pro features a spring steel support frame that redirects the weight to the hips for a more comfortable feel. The Aircontact trail Pro back system is designed to maximize breathability by allowing air to pass between your back and pack, so you stay cooler and sweat less while you hike.","863,862","Backcountry.com","http://www.backcountry.com/deuter-act-trail-pro-40-backpack-2441cu-in?CMP_SKU=DTR002J")

Specifically speaking, the Yukon is equipped with a lightweight aluminum frame that provides structure and stability and the adjustable suspension straps disperse the weight of your load with ease while the padded shoulder straps, dual-density foam waistbelt, and load lifter and belt stabilizer straps ensures an element of down-home comfort. Not to mention, the Yukon is endowed with a vast multiplicity of storage pockets ranging from its generous main compartment to a dual-use laptop or hydration sleeve--so however tempting it may be, we'd just recommend leaving "War and Peace" at home for a rainy day.
